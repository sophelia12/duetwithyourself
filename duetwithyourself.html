        	<h2>Development Process</h2>
        	
        	<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
        	<p>We first brainstormed as many ideas as we could think of.  Then we each went through and wrote our names next to our favorites.  We decided to sketch the four ideas that were selected by all three of us to help work out the details and see which design would be best for our project.</p>

        	<h3>Development Plan</h3>
        	<span>We maintained a Google doc </span>
        	<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AncE_8oBVm6DdGxQdWEzekdtNnhfaWZHZzE2bjREU0E">development plan</a>
        	<span> to keep everyone on the same page.  Initially, we had hoped that Duet With Yourself would have two modes, one in which the line of reflection would split the screen in half and one in which the line of reflection would follow the dancer.  Unfortunately, we realized that the latter mode would not be possible with our two-canvas implementation of the shadowbox, so we had to shelve that idea.  We also ran into difficulties with getting the two canvases on the same line - a problem that was eventual solved thanks to Professor Bernstein's help on Piazza - and with getting the canvases to resize to fit the current window's size.</span>
        	
        	<h3>Video and Finished Product</h3>
			<p>Ultimately, we ended up with a web page that mirrors the dancer's actions next to the dancer, as if he/she was dancing with a partner. The shadow stream also automatically resizes to fit the window it is opened in.</p>
